### HW III Project Descriptions

#### Option 1:  Boston Housing Dataset (`housing.csv`)

**Description:** This a numeric only dataset that contains the sale prices of 506 different houses that were sold in the Boston area.  It is the least demanding of the datasets provided,
but provides an interesting sociological backdrop to think about what drives the price of a house.  Columns are roughly separated into features that describe the house, and features that describe the
neighborhood.
